# RealEstate_PricePredictor
Project Description
This project aims to build a predictive model for real estate prices using machine learning techniques. The model leverages a dataset of property listings, utilizing various features (e.g., location, size, number of bedrooms) to forecast property prices accurately.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the dataset for training, including handling missing values, data scaling, and encoding categorical features.
Feature Engineering: Extracts and selects relevant features to improve model accuracy.
Model Training and Evaluation: Trains multiple machine learning models, evaluates their performance, and selects the best-performing model based on metrics.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizes model parameters to improve accuracy and generalization.
Interactive Visualization: Provides visual insights into the dataset and model predictions using various Python libraries.
Prediction Interface: A user-friendly interface to predict property prices based on input features.
Technologies and Libraries Used
Programming Language: Python
Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Scikit-Learn: For machine learning model implementation and evaluation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
XGBoost/LightGBM: For gradient boosting models (optional, based on project requirements).
Statsmodels: For statistical analysis (optional for regression diagnostics).
